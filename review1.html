            <p class="summary-text">Atomfall is not Fallout. The comparison has been a popular one, but the developers wanted to make it clear that this new IP from the creators of Sniper Elite is "its own thing for sure," and they're right. It is. But there are times when the similarities jump off the screen. Both focus on a post-apocalyptic world full of mutants, warring factions, and--most relatable of all--they both feature a sprawling locked bunker at the heart of their stories. But where the inciting incident in most Fallout games is escaping that bunker, Atomfall asks you to get inside its mysterious facility, The Interchange. It's in that simply stated objective that Atomfall's open-ended world design elevates the game to be something different and interesting in its own right, even as things like stealth and combat drag it down at times.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Just as Atomfall's major brushstrokes are derivative of Fallout and other post-apocalyptic fiction, its story starts with a similar penchant for the cliche. You awaken as an amnesiac in a 1950s-set British countryside. A nearby phone booth rings, and the voice on the other side demands you destroy someone or something called "Oberon." That same voice will call back nearly each time you approach a phone booth in the wild. The cryptic messages don't make a bit of sense, but it does swiftly push you toward your objective: Find and get inside The Interchange, a locked-down facility of some sort that seems to have been the site of a science experiment gone wrong. In there, Oberon can perish, if you so choose.

                The region's people have been left to put the pieces back together following this event, and it's resulted in the forming of several opposing groups, such as the military force that claims authority, roaming bandits who use the chaos as an invitation to resort to lawlessness, and a cult of pagans who believe the catastrophe was good, actually. These territorial factions are often isolated to their own regions, which are experienced as a series of open-world maps that can be explored without limitations as soon as you start the game.</p>

        <div>
            <p>It's this element that quickly shines as Atomfall's best aspect and remains as such. Many people you meet have stories to share, rumors to spread, and quests to gently push you onto. Excitingly, the game doesn't spell this out at its intended difficulty--though, on lower difficulties, it offers a more traditional quest log-- and I found this to be a refreshingly hands-off approach. Instead of spelling things out, you merely pick up "leads" found by reading notes, speaking to NPCs, listening to audio logs, or just simply going off in a direction and seeing what you find there.

                For example, a lead might suggest a vehicle depot was reported to exist at certain coordinates in a specific region. You can then place a marker on your map and follow your compass to the rumored landmark--the game won't do it for you. Maybe you'll arrive to find it's guarded by enemies. Maybe it's vacated but locked, so you need to search for a way to open it. What you're walking into is never clear, so it's always exciting. Early on, your investigations may turn up a few leads, such as where to find nearby traders with rotating inventory, but by the end of the game, I had dozens of leads sorted into categories. The game doesn't even tell you which of these are main-story quests and which might just lead you to something like a weapons cache or a few skill points. This lack of answers makes every breadcrumb feel like it's worth following.</p>
