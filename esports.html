        <p>
          In the world of competitive Valorant, few names carry as much weight
          as Tyson "TenZ" Ngo. The Canadian prodigy has been at the forefront
          of the tactical shooter scene since its inception, setting records
          and redefining what it means to be a professional gamer in today's
          digital landscape.
        </p>

        <p>
          We sat down with TenZ to discuss his journey from a young CS:GO
          hopeful to becoming one of the most recognizable faces in esports.
          In this candid conversation, he opens up about the pressures of
          fame, the evolution of his career, and what the future holds for
          both him and the broader competitive gaming industry.

        <h3>On Finding His Passion</h3>
        <p>
          "I was always that kid who would rather stay inside playing games
          than go out," TenZ recalls with a smile. "My parents weren't
          particularly supportive at first—they saw gaming as a distraction
          from school. It wasn't until I started winning tournaments and
          bringing home prize money that they began to see this could be a
          legitimate career path."
        </p>

        <p>
          His breakthrough came at just 16 years old, when he became the
          youngest player to reach the highest rank in CS:GO. "That's when I
          realized I might have what it takes to go pro. It wasn't just about
          having fast reflexes—I understood the game at a deeper level than
          most people my age."
        </p>

        <h3>Transitioning to Valorant</h3>
        <p>
          "When Valorant was announced, I saw an opportunity to get in on the
          ground floor of something special," he explains. "CS:GO was
          established, with veterans who had been competing for a decade.
          Valorant was a fresh start—a chance to help define a new esport."
        </p>

        <p>
          The risk paid off. Within months of the game's release, TenZ had
          established himself as one of the most dominant players in North
          America. His mechanical skill and adaptability quickly set him apart
          from competitors who were still finding their footing in Riot's
          tactical shooter.
        </p>

        <h3>On Mental Health and Burnout</h3>
        <p>
          "The hardest part of being a pro isn't the tournaments or the
          practice—it's managing your mental health," TenZ says, his tone
          becoming more serious. "There were times I'd practice 14 hours a
          day, seven days a week. I thought that's what it took to stay on
          top, but it's not sustainable."
        </p>

        <p>
          He credits his fiancée, fellow content creator Kyedae, with helping
          him find a healthier balance. "She helped me understand that taking
          breaks doesn't make you weak—it makes you sustainable. Some of my
          best performances came after I learned to give myself permission to
          rest."
        </p>

        <h3>The Future of Competitive Gaming</h3>
        <p>
          "We're just scratching the surface of what esports can become," TenZ
          says with evident excitement. "The production value, the viewership,
          the prize pools—everything is scaling up. Kids today don't just
          dream of being traditional athletes; they dream of being the next
          esports star, and that's incredible to see."
        </p>

        <p>
          When asked about his own future, TenZ is thoughtful. "I want to
          compete as long as I can perform at the highest level. But I'm also
          building for what comes next—content creation, coaching, maybe even
          team ownership someday. The skills I've developed as a pro player
          translate to so many other areas of the industry."
