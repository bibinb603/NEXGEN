            <h2 class="summary-title">Review Summary</h2>
            <p class="summary-text">The First Berserker: Khazan has all the familiar hallmarks of a souls-like--from a bonfire-esque checkpoint system that respawns enemies to XP you can lose upon death--yet its primary influences might not be what you would expect. While its parry-heavy combat is immediately reminiscent of From Software's Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, its level-based structure, weapon skills, and approach to gear are clearly inspired by Team Ninja's Nioh. Developer Neople has some ideas of its own, too, including a multifaceted progression system and cel-shaded art style that makes The First Berserker visually distinct from most of its contemporaries. As a result, this souls-like manages to feel familiar while also carving out an identity of its own, delivering a challenging yet rewarding experience that's anchored by a hard-hitting defensive style of combat and a degree of freedom in how you choose to play.

                In terms of story, you play as the eponymous Khazan. Once a legendary general famed for saving the empire from the fearsome Berserk Dragon, he's falsely branded a traitor at the game's outset. After being mercilessly tortured--with the tendons in both of his arms severed--and exiled to a mountainous, snowy tundra, our hero manages to escape and forms an unlikely alliance with a mysterious entity known as Blade Phantom, who grants Khazan otherworldly powers in his quest for revenge.

        <div>
            <p>What follows from here is a fairly boilerplate tale that's relatively light on story despite its ties to a broader world. The First Berserker is set in the Dungeon & Fighter universe--known for the MMO Dungeon Fighter Online and, most recently, the fighting game DNF Duel--so those familiar with the eclectic series might appreciate Khazan's origins. Those unfamiliar won't feel lost without this additional knowledge, but The First Berserker also gives you little reason to care about its narrative or dark fantasy world. Paper-thin characters anchor a forgettable tale that often tries to elicit emotion from characters you know next to nothing about. At least Ben Starr adds some gravitas in his role as the gruff protagonist.

                Ultimately, the story is little more than a vehicle for getting you from one location to another, and in that sense, it works. As I mentioned earlier, The First Berserker is structurally similar to Nioh as you embark on missions within self-contained environments. There are optional side missions, too, although these bite-sized quests simply revisit areas with revised enemy types and duplicated boss fights. The rewards are worth it, and some are necessary to unlock vital upgrades like a blacksmith, but these side excursions aren't the most interesting from moment to moment. The main missions are significantly stronger, whether you're precariously fighting on the docks of a fishing village overrun by snarling Dragonkin or descending into the bowels of a labor camp in the middle of a barren desert, there's plenty of aesthetic variety.</p>

        <div>
            <p>On the normal difficulty, at least, The First Berserker is tough. Each boss fight, in particular, feels like a skill check for your current prowess, providing a stern test to overcome at the conclusion of every level. These fights never feel unfair, but you're expected to die and learn through your failures, returning stronger and wiser with each new attempt. These battles are exceptionally tense and engaging, and there's a multitude of wonderfully diverse bosses and regular enemy types, too, from dual dagger-wielding outlaws and horned demons to enraged yetis and incorporeal knights. The game's art style, which features cel-shaded characters and backdrops that sit somewhere between realism and illustration, creates a stylistic juxtaposition that brings these creatures to life with anime-esque clarity.

                Despite a forgettable story and some constricted level design, The First Berserker: Khazan's excellent combat is more than enough to cover for these missteps. It's challenging, engaging, and consistently satisfying, complemented by a cavalcade of dynamic enemies and a versatile progression system that extends beyond the typical XP-based approach. It can feel derivative at times, yet The First Berserker's confluence of ideas and influences makes for a thrilling souls-like that stands out in what has become an increasingly crowded genre.</p>
