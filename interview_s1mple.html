            <div class="interview-content">
                <p>In the pantheon of Counter-Strike legends, few names command as much respect and admiration as Oleksandr "s1mple" Kostyliev. The Ukrainian superstar has dominated the competitive CS scene for years, cementing his legacy as potentially the greatest player the game has ever seen.</p>
                
                <p>We had the privilege of sitting down with s1mple to discuss his extraordinary journey from a controversial young talent to becoming an esports icon. In this revealing conversation, he shares insights on his relentless pursuit of perfection, overcoming personal challenges, and what drives him to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in competitive gaming.</p>
                
                <h3>The Path to Greatness</h3>
                <p>"I started playing Counter-Strike when I was around eight years old," s1mple recalls, leaning back in his chair. "My older brother introduced me to the game, and I immediately fell in love with it. I would spend hours watching demos of pro players, studying their movements, their decision-making. I wanted to understand everything about the game."</p>
                
                <p>His professional journey began at 16, but it wasn't always smooth sailing. "The early days were challenging. I had the skill, but I lacked maturity. I was banned from some competitions, and my reputation wasn't great. Looking back, those struggles shaped me into who I am today. I had to learn the hard way that talent alone isn't enough."</p>
                
                <h3>Joining Na'Vi and Finding Home</h3>
                <p>"Joining Natus Vincere was a turning point in my career," he explains with visible pride. "When I first joined, we weren't immediately successful. But we believed in the project, in what we could build together. It took time, patience, and a lot of hard work, but we eventually reached the top."</p>
                
                <p>Under the Na'Vi banner, s1mple has achieved what many consider the pinnacle of Counter-Strike glory, including winning the PGL Major Stockholm 2021, where he was also named MVP. "Lifting that trophy with my teammates, representing my country‚Äîit's a feeling I can't describe. All those years of sacrifice felt worth it in that moment."</p>
                
                <h3>Mental Fortitude</h3>
                <p>"The mental aspect of competing at the highest level is something people often underestimate," s1mple says thoughtfully. "Everyone at this level has the mechanical skill. The difference is how you handle pressure, how you respond to failure, how you stay focused when everything is on the line."</p>
                
                <p>He continues, "I used to get very emotional, very frustrated when things didn't go my way. But I've learned that staying calm, staying focused on solutions rather than problems, is what separates good players from great ones. My mindset now is completely different from when I started."</p>
                
                <h3>The Future of CS2 and Beyond</h3>
                <p>"The transition to CS2 has been interesting. It's essentially the same game at its core, but the subtle differences make it fresh and challenging in new ways," he observes. "The meta is still evolving, and I enjoy adapting my playstyle to stay ahead of the curve. That's what keeps the game exciting after all these years."</p>
                
                <p>When asked about his future, s1mple smiles confidently. "I still have a lot I want to achieve. More majors, more trophies. But beyond that, I want to leave a legacy. I want to inspire the next generation of players to push themselves, to believe that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible. Eventually, I might explore coaching or ownership, but for now, my focus is on competing and winning."</p>
